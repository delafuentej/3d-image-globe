# 🌐🖼 3D Image Globe

A React-based 3D globe that displays images mapped on a sphere. Built with React, Three.js, and TailwindCSS, the globe allows user interaction via mouse or touch and asynchronously loads images for optimal performance.
This project is based on the tutorial **“MacBook Landing Page - GSAP, Three.js, React”** by **JavaScript Mastery**.

## 🔥 Highlights

- Interactive 3D globe: Rotate, zoom, and explore images on a fully interactive 3D sphere.

- Smooth performance: Optimized animation loop only renders when needed.

- Responsive design: Automatically adjusts image sizes for different devices.

- Lazy loading: Loads the Globe component asynchronously for faster page load.

- Fibonacci sphere layout: Images are evenly distributed for an aesthetic visual.
